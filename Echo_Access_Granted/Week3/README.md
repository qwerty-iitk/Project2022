# Assignment3 -> Basics of Web Exploitation

In this week, the mentees were exposed to the field of web-exploitation.

 But before proceeding you all should have basic knolwledge of how websites work, what are the different protocols```(http, https, tcp)```, what all are the responses and status codes of a given request and knowlege about DNS. 

 These all are relatively quite easy and basic things which you should know before proceeding with Web exploitation. 

You all should make account on - https://tryhackme.com/

## Task 1 -> HTTP and DNS

#### HTTP
* ```Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)``` is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. 
* It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. 
* To learn about http, refer this - https://tryhackme.com/room/httpindetail

#### DNS
* The ```Domain Name System (DNS)``` is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. 
* Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
* To learn about DNS, refer this - https://tryhackme.com/room/dnsindetail

For above two tasks, you need to write a short ```README``` file explaining what things you understood and learnt from above tasks (for eg - you can write about what different http methods do, what parameters you need to make http request, what does different status code mean etc). 

## TASK 2 -> INSPECT ELEMENT

* The greatest source about any website/ web-page is the ```inspect tab```. You can learn quite a lot of things about a website from inspect. 

* To explore and learn about different components of inspect, refer this - https://tryhackme.com/room/walkinganapplication

* For this task, you need to submit a short report in the inspect element, what all different components do, what information you can get from those etc.
You need to write a report based on your understanding, you should not copy-paste from the internet or anywhere else.
